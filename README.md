HOW TO USE:

Got to Line 31 in the scrpit where it says " for token in userToken: "  delete "userToken" and put your discord token in the "userToken" to make the bot work.

If you don't put your token you will keep getting an error when you run the bot!!!




Install the requirements below:


import sys

import subprocess

import os

from time 

import sleep


THIS WILL NOT WORK IF REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT INSTALLED








Again i will NOT be held accountable for your actions!!!

I do not recommend that you use this on any servers only personal severs and fake accounts.
